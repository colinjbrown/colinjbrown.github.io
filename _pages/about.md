Colin J Brown is a Data Scientist who is currently working as a PhD student at Northern Illinois University. Colin has a strong background in Python and Computational reproducibility which his Master's thesis was structured around.

During his Research Assistantship under David Koop at UMass Dartmouth he worked with Docker, Python, Flask, MongoDB, D3 and Javascript more than anything else. However as part of his other works he has used other technologies such as R, SQL and Spark.

An example of works that he was involved with can be found at his [github page](https://github.com/colinjbrown), and he is a major contributor to the [Dataflow Python Kernel project](https://github.com/dataflownb/dfkernel).

I'm interested in summer projects or collaborations around reproducibility please reach out if you're interested in working together.
