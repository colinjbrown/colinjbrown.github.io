<a href='https://github.com/dataflownb/dfkernel'>This</a> is a Dataflow Kernel for Python made for use with Jupyter Notebook, it encourages the use of writing reproducible code.

The project relies on recursive dependency calculation, it also allows for the use of dependency introspection between cells. All data is shown in a computational graph so that dependencies between computational cells can be viewed and explored.
