One of the issues that comes up when distributing notebooks is the issue of properly documenting dependencies. 

I created a notebook extension that tracks these dependencies and saves the information into the metadata of the notebook so when you distribute a notebook it contains up to date version information as well as creating a `requirements.txt` file if desired.
